csci535 computational topology project repo

After a semester of learning about Topological Data Analysis (TDA), and in living through a global
pandemic with new data being published daily, we decided that we wanted to apply the information
we had learned about TDA on a data set that relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. We know that data science is a 
powerful tool for finding trends, we hoped that TDA might give insight into how COVID-19 spread. We use TDA to explore
the empirics of how the virus spread topologically throughout the world in hopes to better
understand how modern transportation and government policies, like social distancing, impacted the pandemic.
Since persistent homology can loosely be interpretted an n-dimensional cycles in data, we thought it would be
a useful avenue to pursue to examine the global data. 

This repo contains all the code we used to analyze the data set from the Humanitarian Data Exchange, from
January 22, 2020-April 12, 2020.
